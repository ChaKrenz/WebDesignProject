# Technical Specification: 3D Platformer Game

## Overview
This technical document outlines the implementation of a 3D platformer game using Three.js. The game features dynamic levels, a timer, collision detection, a sprint mechanic, and a responsive UI.

---

## Features

### Timer
- Tracks and displays the elapsed time during gameplay.
- Stops upon game completion.
- Resets when restarting the game.

### Dynamic Platforms
- Platforms can be static or moving.
- Moving platforms use sinusoidal motion along a specified axis with customizable speed and range.

### Levels
- Each level consists of platforms with varying sizes, colors, and positions.
- Levels can be dynamically loaded.
- The game includes checkpoints and final platforms to mark progress and completion.

### Player Mechanics
- Configurable attributes, including jump force, sprint speed, and energy.
- Player movement is affected by gravity and friction (ground and air).
- Collision detection ensures proper platform interaction.
- A view bobbing effect enhances movement realism.

### Game Controls
- Keyboard and mouse controls for movement and interaction.
- Sprinting, jumping, and resetting the game via specific keys.
- Pointer lock enabled for immersive camera control.

### Lighting and Graphics
- Ambient and directional lights enhance the visual experience.
- Platforms and background colors are customizable via a color picker.
- The scene dynamically resizes to fit the browser window.

### Collision and Checkpoint Detection
- Accurate collision detection between the player and platforms.
- Checkpoints trigger progression to the next level.

## Code Structure

### Main Components
1. **Player Object**
   - Contains attributes like position, velocity, sprint energy, and movement configuration.
2. **Platform Creation**
   - Dynamically creates platforms with size, color, and movement settings.
3. **Level Management**
   - Loads level data and resets the playerâ€™s position.
4. **Timer Functions**
   - Start, update, stop, and reset the in-game timer.
5. **Game Loop**
   - Handles animations, collision detection, platform updates, and rendering.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering and animations.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS** for the user interface.

---

## Event Listeners
- `click`: Triggers pointer lock and starts the game.
- `keydown`/`keyup`: Handles movement, sprinting, and resetting.
- `mousemove`: Adjusts camera orientation.
- `resize`: Updates camera and renderer dimensions for responsiveness.

---

## Known Limitations
- Fixed time steps may cause discrepancies in movement and animations.
- No backend for storing scores or player data.
- Limited number of levels.

---

## Recommended Next Steps
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a global or local leaderboard to track player scores.
- **Using Delta Time**: Replace fixed time steps with delta time for smoother and frame rate-independent motion.
- **More Levels**: Design additional challenging and creative levels to extend gameplay.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Introduce shaders or particle effects for a polished visual experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple players to compete or collaborate.
- **Customizable Player**: Add options for players to customize their avatars or abilities.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: Improve immersion with appropriate audio cues and background music.
